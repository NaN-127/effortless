"""API v1 router.

All versioned API routes are registered on this router with the /api/v1 prefix
(applied in app/main.py). Future endpoints such as /api/v1/translation,
/api/v1/speech/translate, and /api/v1/realtime/translate will be added here.

The health check endpoint is NOT versioned and is registered separately.
